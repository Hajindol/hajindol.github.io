    <h1>Loveless</h1>
    <p>In this project, we had to visualize the lyrics creatively by exploring HTML. I used gradient colors to connect each section and created fun compositions. I intended the viewers to interact with the meaning of the lyrics of my website with the fun composition and different weights of the font. Incorporating the artist’s intention of the lyrics, I expressed different visual elements with type. By using contrast in the type size, I conveyed the different emotions shown in the lyrics.</p>

    <h1>Words aren't just words</h1>
    <p>In this project, we had to unfold the story only with images of short texts or poems. This was a project of opportunity to inspect CSS using only images, and through various images that contain the memories of mine, I wanted to express that words and writings, remain not only in my head but also in my heart.</p>

    <h1>Proverbs in Nikolai</h1>
    <p> Nikolai, a typeface created by a designer called Franziska Weitgruber. She reinterprets Nebiolo’s Jenson model from the Renaissance Turiner foundry. Franziska was attracted to its wildness and digitized the bold weight of Nebiolo’s Jenson. I chose Proverbs 16 from the Bible to make a Nikolai type specimen. Nikolai suited perfectly in terms of illustrating the legacy of the bible by a unique bold typeface. Using peacock blue as my main color to convey the elegant aesthetic.</p>

    <h1>Don't know what to eat?</h1>
    <p>This project was an advanced version of using CSS and linking other HTML pages created by our own. I created an informative website where users are being taught while having fun exciting connections with the website. Brings this main yellow for stimulating the appetite of the users and also chooses contrasting color black to drag the user's attention.
    Resulting with developed CSS style sheet was very difficult in the beginning but I truly enjoyed the brainstorming for making this looped HTML because I was thinking about the audience's responsive reactions to this looped website.  </p>
