			<p id="regular3"> To humans belong the plans of the heart,
    but from the Lord comes the proper answer of the tongue. All a person’s ways seem pure to them,but motives are weighed by the Lord. Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans. The Lord works out everything to its proper end— even the wicked for a day of disaster.</p>

    	<p id="regular4"> The Lord detests all the proud of heart.
    	Be sure of this: They will not go unpunished.<br><br>
    	Through <span style="color:#ff66cc"><i>love</span></i> and faithfulness sin is atoned for; <br>
    	through the fear of the Lord 
    	<span style="color:#000000"><i>evil</i></span> 
    	is avoided.</p>

    	<p id="regular3"> When the Lord takes pleasure in anyone’s way, he causes their enemies to make peace with them. Better a little with righteousness than much gain with injustice.</p>

		<div><p id="regular6">The lips of a king speak as an oracle, and his mouth does not betray justice.
		<br>Honest scales and balances belong to the Lord; all the weights in the bag are of his making.
		Kings detest wrongdoing, for a throne is established through righteousness.
		<br>Kings take pleasure in honest lips;
    	they value the one who speaks what is right.
    	<br>A king’s wrath is a messenger of death,
    	but the wise will appease it.
    	<br>When a king’s face brightens, it means life;
    	his favor is like a rain cloud in spring.
    	<br>How much better to get wisdom than gold, 
    	to get insight rather than silver!
    	<br>The highway of the upright avoids evil;
    	those who guard their ways preserve their lives.
    	<br>Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.
    	<br>Better to be lowly in spirit along with the oppressed than to share plunder with the proud.Whoever gives heed to instruction prospers,
    and blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord.

    	<div id="circle-gradient"><p id="regular5">The wise in heart are called discerning, and gracious words promote instruction.<br>
    	Prudence is a fountain of life to the prudent, but folly brings punishment to fools.<br>
    	The hearts of the wise make their mouths prudent, and their lips promote instruction.<br><br>
    	<span style="font-size: 50px">Gracious words are a <span style= "color:lightyellow;">honeycomb</span>,<br>
    	<span style= "color:#ffe8fa;">sweet</span> to the soul and <span style= "color:lightblue;">healing</span> to the bones.</span><br><br>
    	There is a way that appears to be right,but in the end it leads to death.<br>
    	The appetite of laborers works for them; their hunger drives them on.
    	<br>A scoundrel plots evil, and on their lips it is like a scorching fire.
    	<br>A perverse person stirs up conflict,and gossip separates close friends.
